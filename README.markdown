World of Warcraft addon to mount/dismount with some random

command is /rm mount (bind it to a macro)

in order to add mounts in your collection, type
/rm add TYPE MOUNT_SPELL_ID 
      where TYPE is F for flying mounts, S for swimming mounts, N for other mounts
	  you can find MOUNT_SPELL_ID on wowhead, blizz armory
	  
This addon perfectly fit my needs, it may be bugged
